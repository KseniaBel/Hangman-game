Implementation of the Hangman game.

- The game uses a file as a dictionary containing all words and categories for the game. 
- In the beggining of the game, the player chooses a category.
- Afterwards, a random word from the chosen category displays on the screen with the letters masked by "_" symbols.
- The player should guess the word by inputing one letter at a time. 
- If the player guesses a word he will receive a point for his score and will continue playing.
- The game will finish when the player makes 10 mistakes for one word.
